## ✨ What's New

### 📱 Gravity Scroll - Hands-Free Reading
The headline feature of this release is **Gravity Scroll**, a revolutionary way to read manga hands-free! Simply tilt your device to navigate through pages.

- **Tilt-based navigation**: Tilt your phone forward to scroll up, backward to scroll down
- **Customizable sensitivity**: 10-level sensitivity slider (1-10) to adjust tilt responsiveness
- **Auto/Manual calibration**: Choose between automatic calibration when your phone is still, or manual calibration with a tap
- **Haptic feedback**: Light vibration confirms scroll start/stop for tactile feedback
- **Real-time tilt indicator**: Visual display shows your current tilt angle and scroll direction
- **Built-in walkthrough**: Interactive tutorial introduces new users to gravity scroll controls

**Battery optimization**: The feature uses throttled sensor updates (10Hz) and frame processing (30fps) to minimize battery impact while maintaining smooth scrolling.

### 🛡️ Critical Data Loss Fix (MMKV Migration)
**Fixed random data loss issues** where history, bookmarks, and downloads would occasionally disappear when closing and reopening the app.

- **Root cause**: AsyncStorage has a 6MB limit on Android. When users accumulated large amounts of history and downloads, storage would fail silently, causing data loss on app restart.
- **Solution**: Migrated from AsyncStorage to **MMKV** - a faster, more reliable storage solution without size limits.
- **Zero data loss**: Seamless one-time migration automatically transfers all existing data (history, bookmarks, downloads) to the new storage on first app launch.
- **Better reliability**: MMKV is significantly faster and has no practical storage limits, preventing future data loss issues.

### 🔧 Android Enhancements

#### New Permissions
- Added `VIBRATE` permission to AndroidManifest.xml for haptic feedback support

#### ProGuard Rules
- Updated ProGuard rules to include Google Play Services, Firebase, and OkHttp libraries for better release build optimization

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Navigation & Notifications
- Fixed null safety issue in BottomNavigation notification handling that could cause crashes with certain notification payloads

#### Authentication
- Added validation to ensure Google Sign-In configuration is properly set before attempting sign-in, preventing confusing error messages

### 📦 Dependencies & Configuration

#### New Dependencies
- `react-native-sensors` (^7.3.6) - Access device accelerometer for tilt detection
